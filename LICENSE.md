Yes, the SIL OFL license grants you permission to redistribute those fonts. Remember, when you license your code (e.g. by placing a LICENSE.txt file in the root directory), you are only licensing your code of which you own the copyright. You do not own the copyright on any of the other libraries. Those libraries and fonts allow you to distribute them as you wish but are not giving you ownership of their copyright. To comply with their license, you must include each of their copyright notices in your repo (e.g. inside their respective folders or in the LICENSE.txt file, clearly stating which folder is covered by which copyright).
